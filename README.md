# Skin cancer detection with deep neural network

## CorgiVision group project

### Participants:

* Barbara Kéri - AR5KHR
* Benjámin Csontó - JTB4Y1
* Sámuel Csányi - I7ULKV

### Kaggle ISIC 2024 challange 

In this project, we will develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes. Your binary classification algorithm could be used in settings without access to specialized care and improve triage for early skin cancer detection.
